As of writing (check `git blame`), I'm working with a friend through [a series of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoyEIY-nZq_uipRkxG79uzAgfqDuHzot-) on implementing [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system).
I learned about the queer yet awesome [ParseBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/parsebox) library a few weeks ago, which implements an elegant parser combinator system entirely within TypeScript's types.
I adore TypeScript's type system—it's a beautiful and crazy expressive functional language—and so thought it might be interesting to implement the lectures here before moving to a "more sensible" lang like Rust or Lean.
